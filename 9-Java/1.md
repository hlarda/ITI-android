# Applet

- Applet is a small application.
- It is a Java program that can be embedded in an HTML page.
- It runs inside the web browser and works at client side as it's downloaded from the server and interpreted by the browser using JRE.
- To protect the system from malicious applets, Java prevents applets from performing certain operations with the local filesystem, display, keyboard, and network without user permission.

## Applet Life Cycle

- any thing without a main method or entry point is called applet.
- callback methods are called without developer intervention and are called by applet manager.
- As a developer, you need to override these methods to perform your tasks.

    - It is called to initialized the applet.
    - It is called only once. It is the first method called.
    - It is called when the applet is loaded.
    - It is called before the init() method.

2. start() method:
    - It is called after the applet is initialized.
    - It is called every time the applet is started.
    - It is called after minimized or stopped.

3. paint() method:
    - called every time the applet is started or resized.

4. stop() method:
    - It is called when the applet is stopped or minimized.

5. destroy() method:
    - It is called when the applet is destroyed.
    - It is called only once.

6. repaint() method:
