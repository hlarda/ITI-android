# Building Image for Raspberry Pi 3B+ using Yocto

## 1. Clone the Poky Repository

Follow the [Yocto Documentation Install Guide](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html) to clone the Poky repository.

## 2. Install PI Board Support Package (BSP)

Inside the `poky` directory, run the following command to install the BSP for Raspberry Pi 3:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi.git -b kirkstone
```

## 3. Source the Environment

Run the following command to set up the build environment:

```bash
source oe-init-build-env
```

## 4. Add the Meta-RaspberryPi Layer

Append the layer to the `bblayers.conf` file located in the `build` directory. You can do this manually or by using the following command:

```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-raspberrypi
```

To verify adding the layer, run:

```console
bitbake-layers show-layers
```

**The following steps are done in the `local.conf` file** until the best location for each configuration is determined.

## 5. Set the Machine

Choose one of the supported machines from `poky/meta-raspberrypi/docs/layer-contents.md` and add it to the `local.conf` file:

```conf
MACHINE = "raspberrypi3-64"
```

## 6. Add Shared Directories for Temporary Files

Add the following to the `local.conf` file to set shared directories:

```conf
MUTUAL_TEMP = "/home/hala/windows-a/pi-sato/tmp-poky"
SSTATE_DIR ?= "${MUTUAL_TEMP}/sstate-cache"
DL_DIR ?= "${MUTUAL_TEMP}/downloads"
TMPDIR = "${MUTUAL_TEMP}/tmp"
```

## 7. Enable Multi-threading in Building

Add the following to the `local.conf` file to enable multi-threading:

```conf
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "7"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 7"
```

---

## Additional Steps for Custom Layer and Distro

### 1. Create a Layer

Run the following commands to create a custom layer:

```bash
. oe-init-build-env rpi3_build
bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-custom
bitbake-layers show-layers
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-custom
bitbake-layers show-layers
```

### 2. Create an Image Within Your Layer (Sato Image)

Navigate to the build directory and create an image recipe:

```bash
cd poky/build
mkdir -p ../meta-custom/recipes-core/images && code ../meta-custom/recipes-core/images/custom-image.bb
```

Add the following content to the `custom-image.bb` file:

```recipe
inherit core-image
include recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato.bb

IMAGE_FEATURES += " ssh-server-dropbear "
IMAGE_INSTALL += " strace "
```

### 3. Create a `.bbappend` File

To add specific configuration without affecting the original recipe, create a `.bbappend` file:

```bash
cd poky/meta-custom
mkdir -p recipes-core/base-files && code recipes-core/base-files/base-files_%.bbappend
```

Add the following content:

```recipe
hostname = "custom-hostname"
```

To display which files append to the base-files recipe, run:

```bash
bitbake-layers show-appends base-files
```

### 4. Create a Distro

Create a custom distribution configuration file:

```bash
cd poky
mkdir -p meta-custom/conf/distro && code meta-custom/conf/distro/custom-distro.conf
```

Add the following content:

```recipe
require conf/distro/poky.conf
DISTRO = "custom-distro"
DISTRO_NAME = "Custom Distro Version 1.0"
DISTRO_VERSION = "1.0"
DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = "ext2 3g nfc"
INIT_MANAGER = "systemd"
ENABLE_UART = "1"
```

Set the distro in the `local.conf` file:

```conf
DISTRO ?= "custom-distro"
```

### 5. Download the Meta Layer for the BSP

If not already done, download the meta layer for Raspberry Pi BSP:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi.git -b kirkstone
```

### 6. Add BSP to Layers

Add the BSP layer:

```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-raspberrypi
```

### 7. Add Machine Name to `local.conf`

Ensure the machine name is set in the `local.conf` file:

```conf
MACHINE = "raspberrypi3-64"
```

### 8. Build the Custom Image

Finally, build the custom image using the command:

```bash
bitbake custom-image
```

This will create an image that includes all the features of the core-image-sato with your additional customizations.

## Flashing the Image

Your output image will be `tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3-64/*.wic.bz2`. Extract the image in your build directory and flash it to the SD card.

```bash
cp tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3-64/*.wic.bz2 .
extract *.wic.bz2
sudo dd if=custom-image-raspberrypi3-64.wic of=/dev/sdX status=progress
```

## Connect TTL to the Raspberry Pi

Connect the TTL cable to the Raspberry Pi and open a serial terminal to check the boot process.

```bash
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

## SSH Connection

1. `ifconfig` on the Raspberry Pi to get the IP address.

    ```console
    root@custom-hostname:~# ifconfig 
    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr B8:27:EB:F6:AD:39  
              inet addr:192.168.1.51  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.255.0
              inet6 addr: fe80::ba27:ebff:fef6:ad39/64 Scope:Link
              UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
              RX packets:85 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
              TX packets:165 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
              collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
              RX bytes:18653 (18.2 KiB)  TX bytes:46312 (45.2 KiB)
    ```

    > inet addr:`192.168.1.51` is the IP address you are looking for.

2. On your host machine, Add ip address for `enp2s0` interface within the same network with same subnet mask: 255.255.255.0.

    ```console
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.50/24 dev enp2s0
    ```

3. SSH to the Raspberry Pi:

    ```console
    ssh root@192.168.1.51
    ```

It may sound ridiculous to say that, but don't forget to connect the Raspberry Pi to the network using an Ethernet cable.
